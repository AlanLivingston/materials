    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\">As winter comes to an end each year in Chicago, residents have to cope with driving on city streets littered with potholes. The Chicago Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for fixing city streets and relies on data reported by residents through its</span> <span class=\"c4\">[311 system](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://311.chicago.gov/&sa=D&ust=1609624988073000&usg=AOvVaw296ALFBZCUKzo2lpkCjIfS)</span><span class=\"c0\">. But, how likely is it that your request will be responded to in a timely manner? To answer this question, we can look at data that the City of Chicago publishes on performance metrics for services and repairs such as fixing potholes, broken lights in alley, and downed wires through its</span> <span class=\"c4\">[open data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.cityofchicago.org/&sa=D&ust=1609624988074000&usg=AOvVaw1JdrqSB62VWm4j__u5wv7b)</span><span class=\"c5 c0\"> portal.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\">For this problem, you are provided a comma-separated value file called</span> <span class=\"c3\">metrics.csv which you can find in the same folder as this file</span><span class=\"c5 c0\">. This file contains information on service requests submitted to the DOT broken down by activity. Included in this file are the target number of days to complete the activity and the average number of days it took to complete them.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c5 c0\">Your task is to write a program that displays the average number of days to complete each activity over a calendar year for each year included in the data. This will help us to understand how fast the city responds to requests for each activity and whether they've gotten better or worse over time. The output should show all years for a given activity together (as opposed to all activities for a given year) and should be sorted by ascending year. For rows where the period spans the end of one year and the beginning of another, use the start date for determining the year.</span>\n",

    "<span class=\"c0\">Although we have not covered it yet, you are allowed to use the</span> <span class=\"c4\">[csv](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html&sa=D&ust=1609624988075000&usg=AOvVaw0vnFCOeNNjW_m0CloDPFB2)</span><span class=\"c5 c0\"> standard library module.</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c5 c0\">Write a function that joins together single components of a path to produce a full path with directories separate by slashes. For example, it should operate in the following manner:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c3 c7\">>>> full_paths(['usr', ['lib', 'bin'], 'config', ['x', 'y', 'z']])</span>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c3 c7\"> '/usr/bin/config/x',</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c3 c7\"> '/usr/bin/config/y',</span>\n",

    "<span class=\"c3 c7\"> '/usr/bin/config/z']</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c3 c7\">>>> full_paths(['codes', ['python', 'c', 'c++'], ['Makefile']], base_path='/home/user/')</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c3 c7\"> '/home/user/codes/c++/Makefile']</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0 c5\">The function definition should look as follows:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c3 c7\">def full_paths(path_components, base_path='/'):</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c3 c7\">    ...</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\">The</span> <span class=\"c3\">path_components</span><span class=\"c0\">argument accepts an iterable in which each item is either a list of strings or a single string. Each item in</span> <span class=\"c3\">path_components</span><span class=\"c0\">represents a level in the directory hierarchy. The function should return every combination of items from each level. With the</span> <span class=\"c3\">path_components</span><span class=\"c0\">list, a string and a list containing a single string should produce equivalent results as the second example above demonstrates. The</span> <span class=\"c3\">base_path</span><span class=\"c5 c0\"> argument is a prefix that is added to every string that is returned. The function should return a list of all the path combinations (a list of strings).</span>\n",

    "<span class=\"c5 c0\">You are allowed to use functionality from the standard library for this problem.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "## <span class=\"c7 c17\">Problem 3</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c5 c0\">Nowadays we take word completion for granted. Our phones, text editors, and word processing programs all give us suggestions for how to complete words as we type based on the letters typed so far. These hints help speed up user input and eliminate common typographical mistakes (but can also be frustrating when the tool insists on completing a word that you don’t want completed).</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\">You will implement two functions that such tools might use to provide command completion. The first function,</span> <span class=\"c3\">fill_competions</span><span class=\"c0\">, will construct a dictionary designed to permit easy calculation of possible word completions. A problem for any such function is what vocabulary, or set of words, to allow completion on. Because the vocabulary you want may depend on the domain a tool is used in, you will provide</span> <span class=\"c3\">fill_competions</span><span class=\"c0\">with a representative sample of documents from which it will build the completions dictionary. The second function,</span> <span class=\"c3\">find_completions</span><span class=\"c5 c0\">, will return the set of possible completions for a start of any word in the vocabulary (or the empty set if there are none). In addition to these two functions, you will implement a simple main program to use for testing your functions.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "## <span class=\"c17 c7\">Specifications</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "*   <span class=\"c3\">fill_completions(fd)</span><span class=\"c0\"> returns a dictionary. This function takes as input an opened file. It loops through each line in the file, splitting the lines into individual words (separated by whitespace) and builds a dictionary:</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "*   <span class=\"c0\">The keys of the dictionary are tuples of the form</span> <span class=\"c3\">(n, l)</span><span class=\"c0\">for a non-negative integer</span> <span class=\"c3\">n</span><span class=\"c0\">and a lowercase letter</span> <span class=\"c3\">l</span><span class=\"c0\">.</span>\n",

For simplicity, all vocabulary words are converted to lower case. For example, if the file contains the word \"Python\" and</span> <span class=\"c3\">c_dict</span><span class=\"c0\">is the returned dictionary, then the sets</span> <span class=\"c3\">c_dict[0, \"p\"]</span><span class=\"c0\">,</span> <span class=\"c3\">c_dict[1, \"y\"]</span><span class=\"c0\">,</span> <span class=\"c3\">c_dict[2, \"t\"]</span><span class=\"c0\">,</span> <span class=\"c3\">c_dict[3, \"h\"]</span><span class=\"c0\">,</span> <span class=\"c3\">c_dict[4, \"o\"]</span><span class=\"c0\">, and</span> <span class=\"c3\">c_dict[5, \"n\"]</span><span class=\"c0\">all contain the word</span> <span class=\"c3\">\"python\"</span><span class=\"c0\">.</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "*   <span class=\"c3\">find_completions(prefix, c_dict)</span><span class=\"c0\"> returns a set of strings. This function takes a prefix of a vocabulary word and a completions dictionary of the form described above. It returns the set of vocabulary words in the completions dictionary, if any, that complete the prefix. It the prefix cannot be completed to any vocabulary words, the function returns an empty set.</span>\n",

    "*   <span class=\"c0\">Repeatedly prompts the user for a prefix to complete.</span>\n",
    "*   <span class=\"c0\">Prints each word from the set of words that can complete the given prefix (one per line). If no completions are possible, it should just print \"No completions\".</span>\n",
    "*   <span class=\"c0\">Quit if the user enters the word \"<quit>\".</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span class=\"c0\">To call the</span> <span class=\"c3\">main()</span><span class=\"c0\"> function, put a block at the end of your script with the follow lines (we will discuss this technique later on in the class). This allows your script to run when executed from a command line.  \n",
