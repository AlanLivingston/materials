    "As winter comes to an end each year in Chicago, residents have to cope with driving on city streets littered with potholes. The Chicago Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for fixing city streets and relies on data reported by residents through its 311 system. But, how likely is it that your request will be responded to in a timely manner? To answer this question, we can look at data that the City of Chicago publishes on performance metrics for services and repairs such as fixing potholes, broken lights in alley, and downed wires through its open data portal.\n",
    "For this problem, you are provided a comma-separated value file called metrics.csv. This file contains information on service requests submitted to the DOT broken down by activity. Included in this file are the target number of days to complete the activity and the average number of days it took to complete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a program that displays the average number of days to complete each activity over a calendar year for each year included in the data. This will help us to understand how fast the city responds to requests for each activity and whether they've gotten better or worse over time. The output should show all years for a given activity together (as opposed to all activities for a given year) and should be sorted by ascending year. For rows where the period spans the end of one year and the beginning of another, use the start date for determining the year.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nowadays we take word completion for granted. Our phones, text editors, and word processing programs all give us suggestions for how to complete words as we type based on the letters typed so far. These hints help speed up user input and eliminate common typographical mistakes (but can also be frustrating when the tool insists on completing a word that you donâ€™t want completed).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement two functions that such tools might use to provide command completion. The first function, fill_competions, will construct a dictionary designed to permit easy calculation of possible word completions. A problem for any such function is what vocabulary, or set of words, to allow completion on. Because the vocabulary you want may depend on the domain a tool is used in, you will provide fill_competions with a representative sample of documents from which it will build the completions dictionary. The second function, find_completions, will return the set of possible completions for a start of any word in the vocabulary (or the empty set if there are none). In addition to these two functions, you will implement a simple main program to use for testing your functions.\n",
