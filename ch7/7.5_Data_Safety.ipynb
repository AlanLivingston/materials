    ">The 95% confidence interval is a range of values that you can be 95% certain contains the true mean of the population. As the sample size increases, the range of interval values will narrow, meaning that you know that mean with much more accuracy compared with a smaller sample.\n",

However, for really small numbers of samples (under 120), we can use the wider, flatter [t-distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/t-distribution/), which _looks like_ the normal distribution at and above about 120 samples."

So, we already have some issues. But letâ€™s stick to continuity errors specifically. \n",

    "Frequently body mass index data gets categorized as â€˜normal weightâ€™ (24.9 or lower) or â€˜overweightâ€™ (above 24.9). Where is underweight? Also, what is the difference between a 24.8 and a 25.1? When these middle values get averaged together with extremes on either end, it looks like this 0.2 difference in the middle is a night and day difference. Itâ€™s not. Weâ€™re just representing a wide range with a tiny number of categories. \n",
